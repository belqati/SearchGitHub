*SearchGitHub* is an app created under the direction of [Brad Traversy](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/) in his *Modern JavaScript from the Beginning* course. The app uses the following technologies:

  * JavaScript ES5
  * JavaScript ES6
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Bootstrap 4 and Bootswatch

The app needs to be refactored with a simple server in order to take advantage of environment variables using `dotenv`. If you wish to use this app for your own purposes, simply replace `process.env.GIT_CLIENT_ID` and `process.env.GIT_CLIENT_SECRET` in `github.js` with your own GitHub API keys. See [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) to register your app if you do not have keys.
